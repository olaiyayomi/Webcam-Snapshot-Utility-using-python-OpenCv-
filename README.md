# Webcam-Snapshot-Utility-using-python-OpenCv-
The Webcam Snapshot Utility is a simple Python script using the OpenCV library to capture a snapshot from your computer's webcam. It converts the captured frame to grayscale and saves it as a JPEG image file. The script checks if a file with the specified name already exists and prompts the user to either replace it or exit the program.
